# Cooking Club

Cooking Club is a website that tries to remove the fear out of cooking that many young people share and to motivate them. It targets mostly younger people that have thought about getting started with cooking, but got overwhelmed or lost motivation. The website will be useful for beginners to see exactly where they can find a club location.

## Bugs

### Solved bugs
 - Navigation bar used to stick to the screen so when you moved to other sections it would remain visible. However, it caused a few issues since it would cover content when interacting with the links inside it.

### Unfixed Bugs
 - Navigation link randomly gets stuck while scolling to target section.

## Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator]()
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator]()
- Accessibility
 - I confirmed that the colors and fonts chosen are easy to read and accessible by running it through lighthouse in devtools.
